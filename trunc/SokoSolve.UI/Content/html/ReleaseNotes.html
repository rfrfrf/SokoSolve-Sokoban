	    <h1>SokoSolve | Release Notes</h1>
	
	    <h2>Release: 1.2.0-alpha</h2>
	    <p>The 1.2.0 is an entirely new codebase and is a completely new architecture and design. It features much
	     more advanced design patterns (perhaps a little over-architected) and is a more mature implementation.</p>
	     <p>1.2.0-alpha is essentially a pre-release to iron out the kinks in preparation for a mass-appeal beta release. 
	     This alpha is for early adopters, contributors and testers.</p>
	     <p>While 1.2.0-alpha a pre-release, it is intended to be usable and stable.</p>
	     <p>The 1.2.* release will <b>*NOT*</b> include the solver code and related analysis pieces.</p>
