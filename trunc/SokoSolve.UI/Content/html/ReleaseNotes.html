	    <h2>Release: 1.2.17-alpha</h2>
	    <div class="quote">The 1.2.17 is a big step toward a beta version of the Game block, featuring: Advanced Mouse Movement,
	    Bookmakes, Sound &amp; Music, and a User Profile.</div>
	    <p>The 1.2.17 is a big step toward a beta version of the Game block. It features:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li><b>Advanced Mouse Movement</b>. Player movement (l-click) to any open floor cell. Crate movement (l-click drag) any crate to another open floor cell.</li>
	        <li><b>Bookmarks</b>. The ability to bookmark a position then restart from it an any further stage</li>
	        <li><b>Sound &amp; Music</b>. Sound effects and background mp3 playback (this uses embedded Windows Media Player)</li>
	        <li><b>User Profile</b>. Remember which library and puzzle the user is playing</li>
	    </ul>
	
	    <h2>Release: 1.2.0-alpha</h2>
	    <p>The 1.2.0 is an entirely new codebase and is a completely new architecture and design. It features much
	     more advanced design patterns (perhaps a little over-architected) and is a more mature implementation.</p>
	     <p>1.2.0-alpha is essentially a pre-release to iron out the kinks in preparation for a mass-appeal beta release. 
	     This alpha is for early adopters, contributors and testers.</p>
	     <p>While 1.2.0-alpha a pre-release, it is intended to be usable and stable.</p>
	     <p>The 1.2.* release will <b>*NOT*</b> include the solver code and related analysis pieces.</p>
