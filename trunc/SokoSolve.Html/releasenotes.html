	    <h1>SokoSolve | Release Notes</h1>
	    
	    <h2>Release: 1.3.45-beta</h2>
	    <p>The 1.3.45 is essentially a bug-fix revision to 1.3.44. Thanks to all for your feedback on SokoSolve.</p>
	    <ul>
            <li>Installer did not include all content</li>
            <li>Redesigned the dynamic resource XML to allow more complete control and skinning of the game block.</li>
            <li>Solver fixes and cleanups.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h2>Release: 1.3.44-beta</h2>
	    <div class="quote">The 1.3 release is the first beta of SokoSolve. It also features the newly rearchitected Solver block. 
	    The focus of this release is twofold, to introduce the first cut of the Solver and Stability.</div>
	    <p>The 1.3.44-beta release includes:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Solver Block. See the <a href="solver.html">Solver</a> page</li>
	        <li>Import Wizard (XSB, SLC formats) from file, internet or clipboard</li>
	        <li>Much improved editor</li>
	        <li>Numerous library bug fixes and cleanups</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h2>Release: 1.2.18-alpha</h2>
	    <div class="quote">The 1.2.18 release is a big step toward a beta version of the Game block. Featuring:
            Advanced Mouse Movement, Bookmarks, Sound &amp; Music, and a User Profile.</div>
	    <p>The 1.2.18 release is a big step toward a beta version of the Game block. It features:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li><b>Advanced Mouse Movement</b>. Player movement (l-click) to any open floor cell. Crate movement (l-click drag) any crate to another open floor cell.</li>
	        <li><b>Bookmarks</b>. The ability to bookmark a position then restart from it an any further stage</li>
	        <li><b>Sound &amp; Music</b>. Sound effects and background mp3 playback (this uses embedded Windows Media Player)</li>
	        <li><b>User Profile</b>. Remember which library and puzzle the user is playing</li>
	    </ul>
	
	    <h2>Release: 1.2.0-alpha</h2>
	    <p>The 1.2.0 is an entirely new codebase and is a completely new architecture and design. It features much
	     more advanced design patterns (perhaps a little over-architected) and is a more mature implementation.</p>
	     <p>1.2.0-alpha is essentially a pre-release to iron out the kinks in preparation for a mass-appeal beta release. 
	     This alpha is for early adopters, contributors and testers.</p>
	     <p>While 1.2.0-alpha a pre-release, it is intended to be usable and stable.</p>
	     <p>The 1.2.* release will <b>*NOT*</b> include the solver code and related analysis pieces.</p>
