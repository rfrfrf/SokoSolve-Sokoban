	    <h1>SokoSolve | Contributions</h1>
	     <p>SokoSolve is far from a finished product, as such there are many contributions needed. If you have the time and inclination,
	     any help would be appreciated, and will be fully adknowledged. 
	     Contact <a href="mailto:bitwacker@users.sourceforge.net">bitwacker@users.sourceforge.net</a></p>
	     
	    <h2>Puzzles</h2>
	     <p>SokoSolve needs new and interresting puzzle libraries that can be added to the distribution. General discussion
	     for puzzles should take place on the discussion forums, along with with puzzle submissions.</p>
	    
        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        <p>New skins, logos, buttons, backgrounds.</p>
        
        <h2>Sounds &amp; Music</h2>
        <p>SokoSolve needs a rich array of sound effects and background music.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>.MP3 highly compresses as looping background music</li>
            <li>.WAV sound effects for steps, pushes, goal pushes, puzzle completion, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Internationalisation</h2>
        <p>It would be great to get translations in place for other languages.</p>
        
        <h2>Testers</h2>
        <p>A group of testers is needed to check the release and suggest improvements.</p>
