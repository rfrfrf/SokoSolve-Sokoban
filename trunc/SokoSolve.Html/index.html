        Status</h2>
    <p>
        The current version of SokoSolve is 1.2.18-alpha release, which represents a complete
        rewrite to the .NET 2 platform, a brand new architecture and numerous powerful features.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Blocks</h2>
    <h3>
        Game</h3>
    <p>
        Allow the player to solve puzzles in an animated environment, which includes mouse
        movement. Coming soon sounds effects and music. The ultimate aim is for the user
        to play against the solver, or other human players.</p>
    <h3>
        Library</h3>
    <p>
        The real home for any Sokoban enthusiast. The library features an extensible XML
        implementation with rich content, saved solutions, puzzle alternatives, a puzzle
        editor, and import and export tools.</p>
    <h3>
        Solver</h3>
    <p>
        This was the reason this project started. The ability to solver and analyse puzzles
        from the library. Technically, this is the only block that is interesting. Additional
        solver information is managed <a href="solver.html">here</a>. As of 1.2.0 the solver
        has been temporarily removed to focus on stability. It will be reintroduced soon!</p>
    <h3>
        Generator</h3>
    <p>
        This is essentially the end-goal for the project. To be able to generate interesting
        (from a human perspective) puzzles, which are checked as valid by the solver, and
        then played in the Game/Library blocks. This feature is currently under development.</p>
