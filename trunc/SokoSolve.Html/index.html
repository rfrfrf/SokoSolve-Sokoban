	    <h2>Status</h2>
	    <p>The current version of SokoSolve is 1.2.0, which represents a complete rewrite to the .NET 2 platform. 
	    For a more detailed <a href="features.html">progress</a> &amp; features report, which is not completely acurate and only pertains to the latest source.</p>
	    <h2>Blocks</h2>
	    <h3>Library</h3>
	    <p>An XML library of Sokoban puzzles (XSD, XSLT), were the user can easily manage many puzzle 
	       libraries with rich information</p>
	    <h3>Game</h3>
	    <p>A sprite based game UI with little effects. The aim here is to be able to play puzzles from the library. 
	    Ths ultimate aim is for the user to play against the solver, or other human players.</p>
	    <h3>Solver</h3>
	    <p>This was the reason this project started. The ability to solver and analyse puzzles from the library. Technically, this is 
	    the only block that is interesting. Additional solver information is managed <a href="solver.html">here</a></p>
	    <h3>Generator</h3>
	    <p>This is essentially the end-goal for the project. To be able to generate interresting (from a human perspective)
	    puzzles, which are checked as valid by the solver, and then played in the Game/Library blocks.</p>
