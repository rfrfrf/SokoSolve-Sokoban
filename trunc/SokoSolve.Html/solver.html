	    <h1>SokoSolve | Solver</h1>
	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    <p>This is an automated solver for sokoban puzzles. In essence, the solver tries all possible moves until it 
	    stumbles apon the correct sequence for a puzzle solution.</p>
	    
	    <p>It is the general nature of automated solvers that small (few crates, constrained space) can be solved 
	    very quickly (sub second), while larger maps will take a very long time indeed.</p>
	    
	    <p>The solver was removed from the 1.2.* release series for a complete rewrite, it has been re-introduced 
	    in 1.3.*.</p>
	    
	    <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
	    <p>Each node in the move tree is unique CrateMap (crate positions) and MoveMap (all possible player moves, without a push)</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Weighted Brute Force</li>
	        <li>Forward & Reverse Searching</li>
	        <li>Multi-Threaded - Optimised for dual-core processors</li>
	        <li>Static Analysis for dead maps (unsolvable puzzle states)
	            <ul>
	                <li>Corner Analysis</li> 
	                <li>4x4 Box searching</li>
	                <li>Recess Analysis</li>
	            </ul>
	        </li>
	        <li>Visualisations - I have put more effort into the graphical display of the solver, than into the solver itself
	            <ul>
	                <li>Depth-first banded node display with colour coded state and weightings</li> 
	                <li>Path to root, with immediate children</li> 
	                <li>Bitmaps, with overlays</li>
	                <li>Weighting map</li>
	                <li>Outstanding evaluation list, at time of capture (entire node list is cloned)</li>
	            </ul>
	        </li>
	        
	    </ul>
	    <p>As of 1.3.33 I have not used any external sokoban knowledge, I have tried to stay away from any accepted wisdom (in part for the fun or it
	    in part to see if I come up with anything fresh), no double much to my cost. This was easy as I had to implement all the basics anyway. I am quickly 
	    finding that additional improvements are requiring much more effort.</p>
	    
	    <h3>An unstructured list of C# optimisation findings</h3>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Converted atomic classes VectorInt, SizeInt from class to struct for huge memory and to a lesser degree speed savings.</li>
	        <li>Baselined (history snapshot) each major improvement:
	                <ol>
	                    <li><a href="solver/baseline1.html">Baseline I</a> (v1.2.24)</li>
	                    <li><a href="solver/Baseline2-GL-Laptop-First10.html">Baseline II</a> (v1.3.33)</li>
	                </ol>
	        </li>
	        <li>Ubiquitous use of the strategy and factory pattern have made innovation very easy</li>
	        <li>Abstraction of the SolverController allowed an easy transition to multi-threading</li>
	        <li>Regular Microsoft Performance analysis (Tools &gt; Performance Tools &gt; Performance Wizard) has yielded unexpected 
	        and easy performance optimisations</li>
	        <li>Multi-threading has been a great boon, but has required agressive locking on SolverNode. This greatly offsets the 
	        advantage of leveraging the second Core.</li>
	    </ul>

        <p>Appologies... I am in the guts of the solver implementation, I will come back to this page and proof read. I promise. :-;</p>
