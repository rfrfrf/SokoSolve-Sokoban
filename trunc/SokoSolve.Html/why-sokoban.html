<h1>SokoSolve | Why Sokoban?</h1>

<p>Sokoban is a simple little game, however it invagles its way into your
brain. The rules are extremely simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Goal: Get all crates onto goal positions</li>
  <li>Rule: You can push, but never pull, a crate</li>
  <li>Rule: Crate may only be pushed into imediately free spaces</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in spite of these simple rules, the game generates some intreging
complexity. There is a <strong><em>hook</em></strong> in looking at what
appears to be a simple puzzle, and then finding to your horror that there is
no obvious solution. You see, the game is deceptively hard and manifests
distinct tactics and strategy. Indeed many times you will look at a puzzle,
and inspite of it appearing inocous, declare it unsolvable while knowing full
well there must be a solution.</p>

<p>I was introduced to Sokoban via the venerable KSokoban. I showed it to
some friend and very quickly we got addicted, so much so, that the next
morning a friend of mine Paul was still going, having lost a night of sleep,
and no doubt having lost some of his sanity too. At this point I know there
was something too the game -- but lacking Paul's ruthless deadication -- I
opted to build a solver instead.</p>

<h3>Why a Sokoban Solver?</h3>

<p>As the rules are simple, the solver is not too bad. Simple puzzles are
easy to find a solution to. But there is room to grow also...</p>
