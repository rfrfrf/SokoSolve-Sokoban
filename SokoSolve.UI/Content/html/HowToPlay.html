	    <h1>SokoSolve | How to play Sokoban</h1>
	    <p>The great thing about Sokoban is that it is really easy to play and intuitive to learn.
	    </p>
	    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
	    <p>You role play as a Japanese warehouse keeper, with the following rules:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>You can push, but never pull crates</li>
	        <li>You can only push a crate into a free space</li>
	        <li>You win when all the crates are on goal positions</li>
	        <li>You loose when a create gets into a position where it cannot be pushed onto a goal</li>
	        <li><i><b>Enjoy.</b></i></li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>Just for clarity sake:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>You cannot push a crate diagonally</li>
	        <li>The order in which you place crate on goals does not matter</li>
	        <li>You can continue playing even though the puzzle is no longer solvable. 
	        I.e. If you push a crate into a corner, and that corner is not a goal -- 
	        the puzzle cannot to solved from this position; however if you do not 
	        notice this you can continue playing in vain.</li>
	        
	        <li>Enjoy.</li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h2>User Interface</h2>
	    <p>To move the player around you can either:</p>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Use the direction key: Up, Down, Left, Right</li>
	        <li>Left-Click on a floor space (you will see little white dots on the floor spaces you can move to)</li>
	        <li>Left-Click on a crate and drag it (again the game will check if you can move the crate)</li>
        </ul>
         <p>Additional Commands:</p>
         <ul>
	        <li>U - Undo a step</li>
	        <li>R - Restart the puzzle from the beginning</li>
	        <li>ESC - Give up and return the the main page</li>
        </ul>
