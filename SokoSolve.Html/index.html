	    <h2>Status</h2>
	    <p>The current version of SokoSolve is 1.2.18-alpha release, which represents a complete rewrite to the .NET 2 platform, a brand new 
	    architecture and numerous powerful features.
	    </p>
	    
	    <h2>Blocks</h2>
	    <h3>Game</h3>
	    <p>Allow the player to solve puzzles in an animated environment, which includes mouse movement. Coming soon sounds effects and music.
	    The ultimate aim is for the user to play against the solver, or other human players.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Library</h3>
	    <p>The real home for any Sokoban enthusiast. The library features an extensible XML implementation with rich content, 
	    saved solutions, puzzle alternatives, a puzzle editor, and import and export tools.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Solver</h3>
	    <p>This was the reason this project started. The ability to solver and analyse puzzles from the library. Technically, this is 
	    the only block that is interesting. Additional solver information is managed <a href="solver.html">here</a>. As of 1.2.0 the solver 
	    has been temporarily removed to focus on stability. It will be reintroduced soon!</p>
	    
	    <h3>Generator</h3>
	    <p>This is essentially the end-goal for the project. To be able to generate interesting (from a human perspective)
	    puzzles, which are checked as valid by the solver, and then played in the Game/Library blocks.
	    This feature is currently under development.</p>
